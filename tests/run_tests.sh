# Host tests of the Felucca sources (no hardware). Run from the repo root after ./build.sh:
#   tests/run_tests.sh
#
# Regression suite (tests/regress.c, tests/target_budget.py; details at the top of regress.c):
#   golden renders  every engine x preset, the GM map on DRUM, voice modes, FX sends, a 4-track mix: one hash
#                   each in tests/golden.txt. A change of the sound fails with the list of renders.
#   health          clipping, DC, peak level, voices free after the release, silence at the end.
#   CPU             instructions / sample per preset and mix (tests/cpu_baseline.txt, +25 %), ns printed;
#                   target: loop instructions of the render functions in the pi32v2 disassembly
#                   (tests/target_budget.txt, +10 %; exact, static).
#   voices          the budget of 8, steal fades, MONO / LEGATO / UNISON keep their note, the VOICE cap,
#                   no hanging notes on any MIDI / key routing.
# UI renders (tests/ui_render.c): every screen in every palette from the real drawing code: the layout lint (no text
#                   off the screen, cut, hidden, overlapping or spilling out of its cell / card; only free text
#                   ellipsised), GREY gray, MONO neutral, the draw cost, the text audit (build/ui_new/text_audit.tsv);
#                   PNGs of GREY MONO GREEN PAPER NIGHT in build/ui_new (tests/ui_render.py), the findings in build/ui_new/report.txt;
#                   FM6's 32 algorithm charts as drawn (no box overlapping, no route through a box or crossing another);
#                   DIGITAL's screens (its algorithm charts, OP ENV) with FELUCCA_FM4=1 too (build/ui_fm4: lint, GREY, MONO);
#                   every frame of the rolling digits (lint, GREY, MONO), their filmstrips in build/ui_slot;
#                   the alignment: every text / icon / keycap meant to be centred, or on its neighbours' line, by its
#                   ink against its box (cells, chips, buttons, rows, knobs, the roll's strip, the keycaps' pills), every
#                   screen in FLAT and LINE and every palette, over every value it can show; 1 px off or more fails
#                   (build/ui_new/align.txt). MENU > LARGE: every screen again (FLAT, LINE, every palette) and the page / value
#                   sweep with the tall cards, the same lint and alignment; sheet_LARGE_GREY.png, sheet_LARGE_MONO.png.
# UI (tests/ui_test.c): the UI sources against stub display / buttons / knobs: sound loads keep the steps and
#                   the track's ARP / SCL / SLICER, the SEQ > PATTERNS loader and its REPLACE? dialog, the
#                   one-step undo of both (SAVE held), REC on TRACKS / SEQ / ARP, STEP and ARP while recording,
#                   MIDI IN ROUT, saves refused while playing and the OVERWRITE? dialog, MUTE on TRACKS KNOB 1,
#                   the DRUM grid (keys, knobs, LEDs, pages, live recording into it, BEAT from PATTERNS).
#                   (0.9.9) The power-on parts (T1 DRUM-X, T2 VOICE, T3 ANIMAL, T4 LOFI, T5 ANALOG, T6 FM6, dry, each
#                   sounding), the engines' display order (place <-> engine round trips; PROGRAM CHANGE in 0.9.8's), a
#                   project of 0.9.8's tracks unchanged; the other UI tests on 0.9.8's tracks (engines.c TRK_OLD).
# Audio / persistence / editor: the real C paths against simulated DMA and NOR flash: bounded overload
#                   fades, shared-voice limits, deferred settings and retries, failed-save rollback, the autosave
#                   (1.2: when it writes, the power-on restore, damaged copies, a write cut short, wear over a session),
#                   malformed transfers, transport-stop timeouts, MIDI and UART recovery; the MENU settings over the
#                   editor (MENU_DESC / MENU_SET: every item, clamping, unknown ids, saving, USB SERIAL applied later).
# LIVE (tests/live_test.c, 0.9.11): GLO > LIVE's modifiers (seq_live.c, ui_live.c): their timing, the ghost, RETURN, BYPASS,
#                   COMMIT + UNDO, recording at the ghost, MANO's keys, RIELES' PISTAS, the GLO chain.
# RATCH (tests/ratchet_test.c): a step's ratchet (x1..x4): its parts in the sequencer (equal, gated, chords and drum
#                   hits whole, one chance roll, swing, no slide or tie out, STOP), FUN8 round trip and older projects x1,
#                   user preset patterns, SEQ > CHANCE KNOB 3 and the roll / grid drawing.
# MOD (tests/mod_test.c): the modulation matrix: slots that do nothing are bit-identical, every source on each
#                   kind of destination, clamping, MIDI CC1 / CC11 / aftertouch routing, the cost of 4 active
#                   slots (at most +5 %), demos in build/mod_demo/.
# PERFORM (tests/perform_test.c): the FX hold layer (src/perform.c): 1/16 starts, stereo buffer effects, the
#                   too-long REPEAT, the SLICER interplay, silent layer keys, idle bit-identical, cost; build/perform_demo/;
# REVERB (tests/reverb_test.c): REVERB TYPE (src/fx.c): ROOM bit for bit as before, SPRING's decay against SIZE,
#                   its chirp (group delay rising with frequency), stability at the corners, level, a model change
#                   without a click, its cost against ROOM (+30 % at most); demos in build/fx_demo/.
# DELAY (tests/delay_test.c, 0.8.4): the delay's line (src/fx.c dly_lo): no leak of the input at the longest TIME with MOD
#                   up (plain, PING-PONG, WIDE), every long division its own length, the line at half / a quarter rate past
#                   what it holds at the full one (the echo's timing and level, the response, aliases and images, the noise
#                   floor against the full rate), no click when the rate changes (TIME swept, the tempo, a load, an external
#                   clock wavering at a boundary), MOD / GRAIN / DIGITAL / ANALOG 120 / PING-PONG / TONE at those rates.
#                   sine (builds without the CC0 samples); demos in build/slice_demo/.
# INPUT (tests/input_test.c): the key / button debounce of hal/fm1_input.h against the TIMER5 scan and bouncing
#                   contacts: a press within 2 scans (<= 2.3 ms), one note per bouncy press, no early or hanging
#                   release, stray samples ignored, fast repeats, the encoders' detents; the LED scan: lit LEDs every
#                   frame, dim ones a short pulse (the second line write) every frame, each only on its own column;
#                   the breath (#119): dark .. ~60 % of lit (DIM LO ~30 %), smooth, no dark run over ~10 ms near its peak;
#                   the power-on sweep (1.1, hal/fm1_led_anim.h): its length, every LED every frame at its level, the
#                   head left to right with its tail, the buttons, the end on the idle glow, the tick as before after.
# CLICK (tests/click_test.c, 1.1): the metronome (src/click.c) and the count-in (src/seq.c) through audio.c: each beat at
#                   the first sample of its block, with a 1/16 track's steps 1 5 9 13 (internal and external clock, DIV 1/8
#                   and SWING too), the accent, the frequencies, length, LEVEL, MASTER, OFF / REC / ON, USB audio bit for bit
#                   without it; COUNT-IN 1 / 2 BARS (step 1 exactly N bars after PLAY, STOP cancels, PLAY again nothing,
#                   never with an external clock), notes in its last eighth onto step 1; build/click_demo/.
# USB audio (tests/uac_test.c): the UAC1 descriptors as a host parses them (with and without CDC; 44100 and
#                   48000 Hz), the ring and packetiser: 44.1 frames per packet, every frame in order (bit for bit),
#                   underrun / overrun, restart; SET_CUR; the 44.1 -> 48 kHz resampler (every frame against a
#                   double-precision one and bit for bit 0.8.8's, response, SNR, THD / aliasing spurs, cost); the stream
#                   at 48 kHz (47..49 frames per packet, fast and slow I2S clocks, switching rates mid-stream).
# USB STEMS (tests/stems_usb_test.c, 0.9.8): the 8- and 10-channel stream at 44.1 kHz against the FM-1's audio ISR and a
#                   host that reads it as the JIANT Stems app does (each packet's buffer wMaxPacketSize; a longer packet is
#                   babble: cut, the endpoint halted 1..3 ms): every packet fits, every rendered frame reaches the app's lanes
#                   once, in order, in its own channel (2 min each, +-500 ppm); 0.9.7's 720-byte endpoint shown dropping
#                   blocks as a field take did; starvation's repeats made up with the frame spread over a packet.
# STEMS (tests/stems_test.c, 0.9.8): fx.c's stems on dense DICE songs: each bit for bit its track's solo render (LOAD FULL,
#                   LITE, ECO with its tail trimming; one core and CORES 2), the six and the FX return summing to the mix,
#                   an empty track exact zeros, a track through the SLICER its own sound as it got through.
# USB audio scheduler (tests/uac_sched_test.c, 0.8.9): minutes of the stream against a simulated FM-1 (the audio ISR's
#                   order, renders as a heavy song's with late halves, starvation bursts, IRQs off) and host (48 kHz,
#                   +-500 ppm): every IN token finds a packet of n +- 1 frames, every rendered frame sent once (exact), no
#                   drift, underruns repeated and made up; one core and CORES 2 (core 1 resampling the half).
# web (web/test_web.mjs): the editor protocol against its mock device, whose tables must equal the
#                   firmware's (tests/descdump.c -> build/host/desc.json; the MENU settings: tests/editor_test.c -> build/host/menu.json),
#                   the package builder, the updater.
# manual (web/test_manual.mjs, 0.9.12): the interactive manual's entries for every control, the search, the screens it
#                   links (tests/ui_render.c's, tools/gen_manual.py), the map from the firmware's chains; the page in Chromium.
# Browser emulator (web/emu, when emcc is there): the firmware in WebAssembly (build/emu) boots, plays keys and MIDI,
#                   draws, lights its LEDs, keeps a save across instances, plays a song bit for bit as the same file
#                   built with cc (web/emu/native_check.c); the cost of 1 s of a heavy song against real time.
# JIANT FM plugin for tuttidaw (web/plugin, with the emulator; weavejam): JIANT_TUTTI's build plays the emulator's song bit
#                   for bit; renders deterministic, of exact lengths, fractional tempo on the grid, the six stems and the
#                   mix, use B's channels, 48 kHz, state; the tutti-plugin/0 protocol against a fake host (plugin_test.mjs).
# DRUM-X OCTAVES (tests/drumx_oct_test.c, 0.8.5): OCT 0 the kit as before (bit for bit); OCT +1 / +2 / +3 every other step /
#                   once / x2 a step in time while held (0.9.17) (stopped and playing), -1 / -2 / -3 SHORT / GHOST / FLAM (length, level, tone,
#                   the grace hit measured); real-time REC: the step's RATCH / ECHO x8 EVEN / TOUCH, the pass after the
#                   very hits heard; MIDI's bands around 35..81, MIDI REC, a project round trip, the OCT message, COMP.
# DRUM-X (tests/drumx_test.c): the DRUM engine (src/drumx_voice.c): every lane sounds, stays under full scale and ends,
#                   MORPH A <-> B (also while a hit rings), PITCH, the hat choke, MRPH on the knob; demos in build/drumx_demo/.
# NOISE (tests/noise_test.c): the engine (src/eng_noise.c): COLR's slope (white, pink, brown), the filter and the
#                   register clock following the key, META periodic at the key, no DC, no clipping at the
#                   corners, a note from silence the same twice, the cost per voice; demos in build/noise_demo/.
# ANIMAL (tests/animal_test.c, 0.8.3): the engine (src/eng_animal.c): CMOS's relaxation oscillator on the key, the owner's
#                   video (chirps at 1.0 .. 1.3 kHz with rising hooks, 2.4 .. 4.5 a second; a trill of 8 .. 10), the cricket's
#                   carrier and chirp rate, TEMP (Dolbear), the Hopf whistle's onset by bifurcation and its pitch, every
#                   preset sounding, no DC, ending, the same twice, no clipping at any mode's corners; demos in build/animal_demo/.
# VOICE words (tests/voice_test.c, 0.8.5): the VOICE engine singing (src/sing.c): Spanish by rules and Japanese romaji on word
#                   lists (phonemes, syllables), English through its dictionary, every bank word's syllables; the lyric
#                   generator (the same lyric per seed, phrases as long as the pattern's notes, bank words); the vowels' F1 / F2,
#                   s / sh / f bands, a plosive's closure and burst, no click at syllable changes, no DC, no clipping at the
#                   corners; notes, held notes, "-", POS, LOOP with the sequencer; LANG OFF bit for bit; demos in build/voice_demo/.
# DIGITAL -> FM6 (tests/fm4_test.c, built with FELUCCA_FM4=1): the retired four-operator engine against its conversion
#                   (src/fm4_convert.c): routes and carriers per algorithm, the presets' PTCH, and the sound (pitch,
#                   centroid, RMS envelope) of its presets and algorithms; demos in build/fm4_demo/. tests/digital_test.c
#                   (FELUCCA_FM4=1 too): DIGITAL's operator envelopes. Default builds have no DIGITAL (engine 1 reserved).
#                   tests/fm4_div0_test.c (UBSan, #61): the conversion without a divide that can be 0 gives the values the
#                   guarded form gave (every INDEX x FLT ENV, random sounds); a 0.9 project with DIGITAL ORGAN converts.
# FM6 (tests/fm6_test.c): the 6-operator FM engine (src/eng_fm6.c, src/fm6_core.c): the 32 algorithms' carriers, the
#                   operator envelopes (stages, rates, the voice ending), bit-stable notes, a click-free retrigger, no DC /
#                   clipping over the factory patches, the macros' directions, PTCH, pack / unpack and the SysEx
#                   layouts, the 6-voice cap, the cost per voice; demos in build/fm6_demo/.
# FM6 BANK (tests/fm6bank_test.c, JIANT 0.6.11 from Felucca 1.4.1): the voice bank (src/fm6_vbank.c) and its editor
#                   commands against simulated NOR: write / read back, its sectors only, a power cut at any byte or erase
#                   (the old bank or the new one), a wrong CRC, SLOT B1..B32, the SLOT values stored before as before.
# DJ FILTER (tests/djf_test.c, 0.9.1): the master DJ FILTER (src/fx.c djf_block, GLO > MIXER KNOB 4): centred, a sequenced
#                   mix bit for bit as 0.9.0 rendered it (never run); the low-pass / high-pass responses (pass band, 12 dB an
#                   octave, the peak, the ends, stereo); no click crossing the middle, jumping sides, swept, automated; its
#                   automation recorded, played, stopped, saved apart ('M' 'G') and loaded; an old project loads it centred.
# MICRO (tests/micro_test.c, 0.9.1): a step's MICRO in 64ths (core.h ST_MICRO): every value, a project of before played
#                   sample for sample and saved byte for byte as 0.9.0 did; live recording at REC Q 0 % within 1/64 of a step
#                   of where played (72 / 120 / 174 BPM, 1/8 1/16 1/32 16T, swing) and played back there; REC Q 50 % half way;
#                   the block 'M' 'F' saved and loaded, without it the sixteenth below; SEQ > NOTE's knob in 64ths.
# ROBUST (tests/robust_test.c): damaged or crafted stored data and editor requests: engine numbers past the last
#                   refused, a retained older
#                   RAM project bounded, user preset patterns inside their fields, malformed requests never stop PLAY.
# Sanitizers (ASan + UBSan, when the compiler has them; SANITIZE=0 skips): the stored-data and protocol tests again
#                   (loader, M-UPGRADE entry, editor, projects, backup, ROBUST) and two short fuzz runs with fixed
#                   seeds: tests/fuzz_ed.c (editor SysEx and raw USB-MIDI packets), tests/fuzz_proj.c (mutated project
#                   stores -> import -> restore -> render). Longer runs: build/host/asan/fuzz_ed 300000 7 (iterations, seed), the same for the others.
#                   UBSan leaves out the DSP's intended wraps (signed overflow, shifts); bounds, object-size and
#                   pointer-overflow stay off as in Felucca (once for the user zones' XIP rebase).
# Change baseline entries only for reviewed, intentional differences in sound or cost;
# retain every unaffected golden / CPU / target entry. VERBOSE=1: every render.
