# JIANT FM for tuttidaw (web/plugin/README.md): the firmware built as the browser emulator's (web/emu/build.sh) with
# JIANT_TUTTI (web/plugin/jiant_plugin.c), and the static site that serves it, per deployment channel:
#   PLUGIN_CHANNEL=production web/plugin/build.sh  ->  build/plugin-site/{tutti-plugin.json, _headers, plugin/, emu/, ...}
#   PLUGIN_CHANNEL=preview    web/plugin/build.sh  ->  build/plugin-site-preview/ (the default; also embeddable from
#                                                      http://localhost:<port>)
#   PLUGIN_CHANNEL="production preview"            ->  both (one wasm)
# The wasm alone: build/plugin-wasm/felucca.wasm. The site links its source to the commit built: the tree must be clean
# (PLUGIN_ALLOW_DIRTY=1: a preview anyway, marked; see site.mjs).
# Run after the generated headers exist (the emulator's: build.generate(), see .github/workflows/plugin-site.yml).
# PLUGIN_OPT replaces -O2, as EMU_OPT does for the emulator.
